    <string name="starting_scenario">You are taking a hike in the forest.\n\n
                                     You have enough food, water and supplies for one day.\n\n
                                     It gets dark, so you turn on your flashlight.\n\n
                                     After a couple of hours, your battery dies and you don\'t have a spare.\n\n
                                     You mentally curse yourself for not being prepared.\n\n
                                     You realize that you can\'t keep walking in the dark, and your supplies are running low,
                                     so you have two options: \n\n
                                     Go find shelter or go find water</string>

                You try to find shelter. Eventually, you spot a cave. \n\n
                Its not the best, but it has to work for now. \n\n
                You unpack your remaining supplies, and try to get comfortable, but
                just when you are about to  go to sleep, you spot something odd on the ground. \n\n
                On closer inspection, its not so odd..just pawprints…  \n\n
                …PAWPRINTS?!? \n\n
                You get really scared that this may be the home of a large predator....like a bear. \n\n
                Fortunately for you, the footprints appear to be fairly old ...like a few days ago \n\n
                You\'re extremely exhausted, but you\'re worried about the bear too. \n\n
                What do you do: Stay and rest, or leave the cave and try to find a safer place to sleep</string>

                                 There are fish swimming slowly in the stream. \n\n
